# Titanic Disaster Analysis (Python)
This project involves the analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset using Python. I utilized unsupervised learning (K-means) to determine likely passenger survival groups and employed supervised learning (Logistic Regression) for survival prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
