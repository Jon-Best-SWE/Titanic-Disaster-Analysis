# Titanic Disaster Analysis (Python)
This project involves the analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset using Python. I utilized unsupervised learning (K-means) to determine likely passenger survival groups and employed supervised learning (Logistic Regression) for survival prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed. Additionally, you can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jon-Best-SWE/Titanic-Disaster-Analysis.git
cd Titanic-Disaster-Analysis
```

2. Analyze the Data
The Python scripts provided in this repository (`Jon_Best_Titanic_Disaster_Supervised_Learning_Code.py` and `Jon_Best_Titanic_Disaster_Unsupervised_Learning_Code.py`) contain code for analyzing the Titanic disaster dataset. They are not meant to be run directly from the command line but should be executed within a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Open in a Python Environment
You can open and run the provided Python scripts in a Python IDE (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook) or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

4. Run the Code
Inside your Python environment, you can execute the code within these scripts to perform the analysis.

5. View the Results
The results and visualizations will be displayed within your Python environment.

Please note that these scripts are designed for data analysis and should not be run as standalone command-line applications.
